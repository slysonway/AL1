Hello everyone, today for this last course, we will play with something fun:

# Networks in Rust

## Lvl 0 - Hello World!

Use tokio: <https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio> to create a small Rust program `alice` that asynchronously wait and print a message sent by a program `bob` using the standard library.

> Learn more about `async`: <https://areweasyncyet.rs> (you can use futures, mio or async-std)

## Lvl 1 - HTTP server

Create a simple HTTP server using <https://hyper.rs>, that display a fancy "It's works!" message in your favorite browser on <http://127.0.0.1:8080>

> There is plenty of alternatives here too: <https://www.arewewebyet.org>

## Lvl 2 - API Request

Using <https://docs.rs/reqwest> play with some external API, like Giphy one: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint and create a small command-line program that takes a parameter and save the GIF image on your computer!

## Lvl ? - Bonus

Want to play with some "real" web framework, you can try <https://gotham.rs> (or <http://nickel-org.github.io>)!

## Lvl ?? - Extra bonus

Do you hear about WASM <https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/>?
